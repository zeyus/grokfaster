So far
----------

+ Option for WPM
+ highlight text and right click - selected text can be displayed to you from context menu
+ Prev and Next word (optional in future)
+ Spacebar for pause
+ Escape / click background to quit



Ideas for further developement:
-------------
+ Slider for WPM
+ Figure out the alto for calculating the focal point
+ Fade article to background (transparancy option perhaps?)
+ Style/color different types of text, such as: "text within quotation-marks", (text within parentheses), bold text, italic text, hyphenation, etc etc
+ Style H1 - H5 text (web-based text styling)
+ Pause-button with possibility to break the auto-reading and bringing up the part of the text that you paused at
+ Pay attention to the punctuation such as comma-signs
+ Longer break/pause needed for new sentience (Give time for cognitive understanding that new information begins) 
+ add pause button (not just space bar)
+ allow user to scan back X words while paused (maybe 5, 10, 15??) with button or keyboard
+ highlight word they were at when they close the reader
